### Name
SEGV when square_width doesn't divide height and width

### Description

When the selected square width doesn't divide the two dimensions, some pixels are not initialized => SEGV  when storing the picture.

### Affected Lines
In `checkerboard.c:99` to `checkerboard.c:100`

### Expected vs Observed
We expect the program to give partial squares when the square width doesn't divide the dimension. But the program returns a SEGV.


### Steps to Reproduce
Enter a square width that doesn't divide the two dimensions


#### Command

```
./checkerboard poc_checkerboard.png 100 100 8 ffff00 00ffff
```


### Suggested Fix Description
Increase the number of squares in the for loop but check that we don't go out-of-bound when coloring the additional squares.
