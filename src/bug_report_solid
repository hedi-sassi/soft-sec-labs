### Name
Command injection bug

### Description

A malicious user can enter a command in the output name argument.

### Affected Lines
In `solid.c:121`, `solid.c:122`

### Expected vs Observed
We expect the program to display statistics about file size but a user can inject commands.

### Steps to Reproduce

Select an output name countaining: <filename> ; <command to execute>

#### Command

```
./solid "output_name; gnome-terminal" 12 12 ffffff


```


### Suggested Fix Description
Check that the output name variable only contains alpha num char and ".", "_", "-"




### Name
Control flow bug

### Description

when an error occurs we expect the palette to be freed (as written in the comments). But a goto is executed before the free => the free is never executed.

### Affected Lines
In `solid.c:49`

### Expected vs Observed
We expect the program to free the palette if the height is smaller than 0 but the program just leave without freeing the memory.

### Steps to Reproduce

Select an output name countaining: <filename> ; <command to execute>

#### Command

```
./solid output_name -1 1 00ffff


```


### Suggested Fix Description
Move the free in the error handling.




### Name
Memory allocation not checked

### Description

In allocate palette we don't check that malloc returned a valid pointer.

### Affected Lines
In `solid.c:9`

### Expected vs Observed
If malloc fails, we will have a SEGV. We expect the program to exit gracefully but we will get a SEGV.

### Steps to Reproduce

Execute the program when you don't have memory.

#### Command

```
./solid output_name 10 10 00ffff


```


### Suggested Fix Description
Check that the memory allocation didn't fail.
