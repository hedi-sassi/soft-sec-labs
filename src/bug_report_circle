## Bug Report

### Name
Invalid coordinates on image border

### Description

The coordinate can be out-of-bound in circle.c in the two for loops since we do x_coord +- radius.
This can cause the circle to affect random/close-by pixels. Or even crash the programm if the circle is centered in the two extreme corners.

### Affected Lines
In `circle.c:46`, `circle.c:47`, `circle.c:54`, `circle.c:67`, `circle.c:68` and`circle.c:75`

### Expected vs Observed
We expect a circle centered on the given center with a change of color inside the radius. We observe randomly colored pixels when the center of the circle is close to the borders or when the radius is too big.

### Steps to Reproduce

Enter coordinate 0,0 with a radius of 10

#### Command

```
./circle poc.png output_image 0 0 10 ffffff
```
#### Proof-of-Concept Input (if needed)
(attached: poc_circle.png)

### Suggested Fix Description
Check for invalid coordinates in the loop with respect to the width and height of the image.
