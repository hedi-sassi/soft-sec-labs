### Name
Buffer overflow vulnerability

### Description

The program makes use of strcpy without checking the input size. There is a buffer overflow vulnerability if a user enters an input bigger than 256.

### Affected Lines
In `rect.c:21`, `rect.c:22`

### Expected vs Observed
When entering arguments greater than 256 characters the program should only consider the 256 first characters. Here the program crashes since we are overwritting memory.

### Steps to Reproduce

Select an input or output name bigger than 256

#### Command

```
./rect a (4000 times) output 0 0 0 0 ff00ff


```


### Suggested Fix Description
Use strncpy with maxe length 256 instead of strcpy.
